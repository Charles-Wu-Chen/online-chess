# online-chess

This project is to build a chess UI that plays against Leela Chess Zero (Lc0) 

Steps:

Frontend: Use a pre-built chessboard UI in a React-based library.

Backend: Set up a server that runs Lc0 (requires GPU acceleration for optimal performance). You can use frameworks like Flask (Python) or Node.js.

Deployment: Host the app on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.

WebSocket/API: Connect the UI with Lc0 via WebSockets or API for move calculation.
